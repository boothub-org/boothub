[[Templates]]
= Writing BootHub templates

Instead of writing a BootHub template from scratch, it is recommended to use one of the following approaches:

- generate a template skeleton using the http://meta-template.boothub.org[Meta-Template].
- copy an existing template that is somewhat similar to the one you want to write and then adjust it to your needs.


[[template-structure]]
== Template structure

The structure of a BootHub template is shown in the figure below:

image::template-structure.png[]

The directories `files` and `files-src` contain file templates that will be processed by BootHub to generate a project skeleton.
The generation is guided by a series of control files in accordance with the project context.
The next sections describe this process in detail.

[[template-info]]
== Template info

Each template provides information about itself. The file `info.yml` contains structured information (such as name, id, version, homepage),
while `description.md` provides a markdown description of the template's purpose and capabilities.

The Boothub GUI displays this information in an aggregated form as shown in the image below:

image::java-groovy-info.png[]

The markdown description uses the http://commonmark.org/[CommonMark] format and should contain only 'safe' elements.
Raw HTML and potentially unsafe URLs in links and images (those beginning with javascript:, vbscript:, file: etc.) are not rendered.

[[project-context]]
== Project context

Before generating a project skeleton, BootHub collects link:#template-independent-data[template-independent] and template-specific data.
These are used to populate the project context, which contains properties needed to customize the project skeleton.

A project context is an instance of `org.boothub.context.ProjectContext`.
Simple templates can directly use this class, but usually a subclass of ProjectContext is needed.
You specify the class required for your project context in the file `config.yml`.

The standard way to extend ProjectContext or one of its existing subclasses is to implement additional
http://docs.groovy-lang.org/next/html/documentation/core-traits.html[traits].
Each trait adds one or more properties to the project context.

The diagram below shows available traits, ProjectContext subclasses and other related classes. Traits are colored blue.

[[project-context-diagram]]
image::project-context.png[]

Looking at the bottom of the above image, you can see that BootHub provides a series of ProjectContext subclasses
(with names of the form `StandardProjectContext.TemplateType`),   which help you create the appropriate project context for your template.
They are useful if your template should generate projects that produce Maven-compatible artifacts (jar, war, ear etc.).

In general, your template needs one or more specific properties that are not provided by the existing ProjectContext subclasses.
Therefore, you need to create a custom project context class for your template.
This involves the following steps:

- create one or more custom traits that provide the additional properties needed by your template.
- choose a suitable base class for your project context class.
- create your custom project context class that extends the chosen base class and implements your custom traits.

The above mentioned traits and classes must be implemented in Groovy and placed in the `script` directory.

TIP: The http://meta-template.boothub.org[Meta-Template] does a good job in choosing a suitable base class for your project context depending on the
options you choose during the template skeleton generation. It also creates a custom project context class implementing a sample trait with a sample property.


Each trait implemented by your project context class must have an associated
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/context/Configurator.groovy[configurator] class,
which you specify using the
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/context/ConfiguredBy.groovy[ConfiguredBy] annotation.

To exemplify, let's look at the project context of the http://java-groovy.boothub.org[Java/Groovy template],
which is implemented by the `JavaGroovyProjectContext` class, as specified in the
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub-template-java-groovy/blob/master/skeleton/template/config.yml[configuration file]:

.template/config.yml
```
contextClass: org.boothub.context.JavaGroovyProjectContext
```

In order to be properly configured, some of the features provided by the Java/Groovy template require additional properties.
These properties are provided by a series of feature-specific traits implemented by the
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub-template-java-groovy/blob/master/skeleton/template/script/org/boothub/context/JavaGroovyProjectContext.groovy[JavaGroovyProjectContext] class:

.template/script/org/boothub/context/JavaGroovyProjectContext.groovy
```
package org.boothub.context

class JavaGroovyProjectContext
    extends StandardProjectContext.Generic
    implements LanguageContext,
               TestFrameworkContext,
               BintraySupport,
               DocPublishing,
               AsciiDocSupport,
               LicenseCheckSupport,
               FindbugsSupport,
               CloverSupport {
}
```

The https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub-template-java-groovy/blob/master/skeleton/template/script/org/boothub/context/CloverSupport.groovy[CloverSupport]
trait provides a boolean property that indicates whether the Gradle script of the generated project should add support for
code coverage with https://www.atlassian.com/software/clover[Clover].

.template/script/org/boothub/context/CloverSupport.groovy
```
package org.boothub.context

import groovy.transform.SelfType
import org.beryx.textio.TextIO

@SelfType(ProjectContext)
@ConfiguredBy(CloverSupport.Configurator)
trait CloverSupport {
    boolean useClover = true

    static class Configurator extends TextIOConfigurator  {
        @Override
        void configureWithTextIO(ProjectContext context, TextIO textIO) {
            def ctx = context as CloverSupport
            ctx.useClover = textIO.newBooleanInputReader()
                    .withDefaultValue(ctx.useClover)
                    .read("Use Clover?")
        }
    }
}
```
Note how the `@ConfiguredBy` annotation is used to specify the configurator class associated with this trait.

The configurator class provides the code necessary to configure the trait properties.
Usually, the properties values are obtained interactively from the user.
In order to allow BootHub to run the configurator code both in the CLI and the web interface,
all input/output operations required by a configurator should be implemented using the https://github.com/beryx/text-io[Text-IO] library.

[[template-processing]]
== Template processing

BootHub uses the https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java[handlebars.java] template engine to process the following files:

- regular files and their control file `files.yml`
- module source files and their control file `sources.yml`
- the usage instructions file `instructions.md`

The tags in the above mentioned documents are expanded using the values of the properties provided by the project context.

Additionally, for each module source file BootHub creates a
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/context/SourceFileContext.groovy[SourceFileContext]
whose properties are also used during tag expansion. See <<mod-src-files>> for more details.



The following helpers can be accessed in the documents processed by the handlebars template engine:
http://handlebars-java-helpers.beryx.org[Handlebars.java Helpers],
https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/blob/master/handlebars/src/main/java/com/github/jknack/handlebars/helper/StringHelpers.java[StringHelpers]
and
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/hbs/Helpers.groovy[BootHub's Helpers].



[[reguar-files]]
== Regular files

Regular files reside in the `files` directory (or in its subdirectories) and are controlled by the `files.yml` file, which configures a list of
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/context/FileContext.groovy[FileContext]s.

A FileContext instance is characterized by three properties that tell BootHub how to handle a particular file:

- `String filePath` (mandatory) - the path of the source file relative to the `template` directory.
If the file is located directly under the `template` directory, the filePath contains only the file name.
Otherwise, it has the format `subdirectory/fileName`.
- `String targetPath` (optional) - the destination path relative to the target directory. If missing, the `filePath` value will be used.
- `boolean enabled` (optional) - whether this file should appear in the generated project skeleton. Default value: `true`.


For example, the following entry can be found in the
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub-template-java-groovy/blob/master/skeleton/template/files.yml[files.yml] of the Java/Groovy template:

```
--- !!org.boothub.context.FileContext
filePath: settings.gradle
enabled: {{multiModule}}
```

This means that the file `settings.gradle` located directly under the `template` directory should appear in the generated skeleton only if
a multi-module project is desired. Since no `targetPath` is specified, the file will retain its original name and relative location.


The content of https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub-template-java-groovy/blob/master/skeleton/template/files/settings.gradle[settings.gradle] is shown below:

```
rootProject.name = '{{ghProjectId}}-root'

String[] modules = [
    {{~#each modules}}
    '{{artifact}}',
    {{~/each}}
]

include modules
```

If a regular file doesn't have a corresponding FileContext entry in `files.yml`, it will appear unconditionally in the generated project,
retaining its original name and relative location.


[[mod-src-files]]
== Module source files

Module source files reside in the `files-src` directory.
They are needed for Maven-compatible project skeletons, which consist of one or many modules, where each module usually produces an artifact.

Each module is described by a
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/context/SourceContext.groovy[SourceContext]
configured in the `sources.yml` file.
Each SourceContext contains the name of the artifact produced by its corresponding module and a list of
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/context/SourceFileContext.groovy[SourceFileContext]s
associated with this module.

A SourceFileContext instance is characterized by the following properties that tell BootHub how to handle a particular source file:

- `String fileName` (mandatory) - the name of the source file.
- `String targetBaseDir` (optional) - the base directory of the target file relative to the module path. Default value: empty string.
- `String targetPackage` (optional) - the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_package[package] of this source file. Default value: empty string.
BootHub will place the target file in a subdirectory corresponding to the `targetPackage` in the `targetBaseDir`.
- `String targetFileClass` (optional) - the name of the class defined by this source file. If missing, the class name is set in accordance with the `fileName`.
- `boolean enabled` (optional) - whether this source file should appear in the current module. Default value: `true`.

Below you can see a fragment of the
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub-template-java-groovy/blob/master/skeleton/template/sources.yml[sources.yml] file of the Java/Groovy template:

```
{{#each modules}}
--- !!org.boothub.context.SourceContext
artifact: {{artifact}}
fileContexts:
    - !!org.boothub.context.SourceFileContext
      fileName: JavaMain.java
      targetBaseDir: src/main/java
      targetPackage: {{basePackage}}
      targetFileClass: {{appMainClass}}
      enabled: {{and useJava (not useGroovy) appMainClass (compare artifact '==' appModule.artifact)}}

    - !!org.boothub.context.SourceFileContext
      fileName: JavaUtil.java
      targetBaseDir: src/main/java
      targetPackage: {{basePackage}}
      targetFileClass: {{artifactAsClassName}}JavaUtil
      enabled: {{and useJava (or useGroovy (not appMainClass) (compare artifact '!=' appModule.artifact))}}

    # ...
    # more SourceFileContext entries...
    # ...

{{/each}}
```

For simplicity, the example above contains only two of the SourceFileContext entries present in the actual `sources.yml` file.

The handlebars tags will be replaced with the values of their corresponding project context properties during the template processing.
The `useJava` and `useGroovy` are specific to the Java/Groovy template, while the other ones are common properties you can find in the
<<project-context-diagram,project context diagram>>.

Note that the handlebars processing of the above `sources.yml` file will produce a SourceContext for each module present in the project context.
For pure Java projects the `JavaMain.java` source file is enabled only for the application module, while `JavaUtil.java` is enabled for the other modules.

Note also that these two source files will have custom names in the generated project, since a `targetFileClass` is specified for them.


The content of `JavaMain.java` is shown below:

```
\{{javaComment 'license-header.txt'~}}
package {{targetPackage}};

public class {{targetFileClass}} {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello from {{targetFileClass}}!");
    }
}
```

Source files are processed twice by Handlebars: first time using their corresponding
https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/groovy/org/boothub/context/SourceFileContext.groovy[SourceFileContext]
and then using the project context.

CAUTION: Note the `\{{` at the beginning of the first line in the `JavaMain.java` template.
The `\` prevents Handlebars from handling the `javaComment` tag during the first processing step (with the SourceFileContext).
Instead, it will be handled during the second processing step (with the project context).


== Usage instructions

After generating a project, the BootHub web interface processes the markdown content found in the file `instructions.md`
in order to display usage information related to this project:

image::java-groovy-instructions.png[role="related thumb"]

The markdown description uses the http://commonmark.org/[CommonMark] format and should contain only 'safe' elements.
Raw HTML and potentially unsafe URLs in links and images (those beginning with javascript:, vbscript:, file: etc.) are not rendered.


== License files
By default, BootHub provides 13 https://github.com/boothub-org/boothub/blob/master/boothub-core/src/main/resources/licenses.zip[software licenses] to choose from.

You can provide additional licenses for your template in the `template/licenses` directory.
For each additional license you need to create a subdirectory whose name represents the `licenseId`.
In this subdirectory you should place three files:

- `LICENSE` - contains a plain-text copy of the license
- `license-header.txt` - contains a short license header that should usually be included at the top of each source file.
- `license.yml` - a YAML file that configures the license name and, optionally, a URL to the license text.

For example, if your template additionally provides the http://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic_license_2_0[Artistic license 2.0],
the following `license.yml` file should be present in the `template/licenses/Artistic-2.0` directory:

.template/licenses/Artistic-2.0/license.yml
```
licenseName: The Artistic License 2.0
licenseUrl: http://www.perlfoundation.org/attachment/legal/artistic-2_0.txt
```

BootHub adds the properties configured in `license.yml` to the project context.

BootHub configures the values specified in `license.yml` to the project context.


BootHub reads the content of the `license.yml` file associated with the license type chosen by the user
and adds each entry to the `ext` property of the project context.
Therefore, you can include these values in any file processed by the <<template-processing,template engine>>
by using the tags `{{ext.licenseName}}` and `{{ext.licenseUrl}}`.
